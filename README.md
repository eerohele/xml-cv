xml-cv
======

A (toy) application for generating a nice HTML5 CV from an XML file with XSLT.
Not ready for real-life use, but good enough to generate my personal CV.

Contains:

- A [RelaxNG][rng] schema for validating the input file
- An XSLT stylesheet for the XML-to-HTML5 conversion
- A set of CSS stylesheets
- A [Gradle][gradle] build script

Sample output forthcoming.
